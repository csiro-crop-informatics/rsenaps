# Introduction

`RSenaps` is a R package to communicate with [Senaps platform](http://sensor-cloud.io). 

# Before start
A user account needs to be created in [Senaps](http://sensor-cloud.io). It it much securer to use `api key` to make requests to Senaps, NOT the username and pasword. The `api key` can be stored in the environmental variable and read in your Rscript (e.g. `SENAPS_API_KEY`).

The `apikey` can be set using `senaps_option`.

```{r}
senaps_options(apikey = Sys.getenv('SENAPS_API_KEY'))
```
